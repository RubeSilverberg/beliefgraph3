This tool lets you build belief networks with minimal setup. Add nodes ('N' or right click), connect them (left click), label them (double-click) and set qualitative weights (double click on connector lines). Most features are self-explanatory.
•	Purpose: Designed to generate valid numerical estimates for beliefs - useful for legal, investigative, or general reasoning contexts.
•	Bayes Lite: Default mode. Gives reasonable - if approximate - probability estimates. No math required - just build your network and choose influence strengths. Facts vs. assertions are handled automatically. Outputs: node probabilities and a qualitative 'robustness' score (how well-supported each node is).
•	Bayes Heavy: Toggle on for more rigorous, probability-driven inference (naive Bayesian network). Here you'll assign explicit baseline and conditional probabilities for each edge. Structure edits are disabled in this mode; switch back to Lite to revise.
•	Assumptions: Heavy mode assumes independent inputs unless you use logic nodes.
•	AND/OR nodes: Provided for modeling logical relationships when needed, but most users can ignore them.
•	Other features: Optional adjustment for node size and color, as well as different ways to present explanatory info.
