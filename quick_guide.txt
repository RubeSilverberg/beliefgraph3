This tool lets you build belief networks with minimal setup. Use point-and-click (right click, double click) to add nodes, connect them, and set qualitative weights. Most features are self-explanatory.
•	Purpose: Designed to give valid, numerical weights to beliefs - useful for legal, investigative, or general reasoning contexts.
•	Bayes Lite: Default mode. No math required - just build your network and choose influence strengths. Facts vs. assertions are handled automatically. Outputs: node probabilities and a qualitative 'robustness' score (how well-supported each node is).
•	AND/OR nodes: Provided for modeling logical relationships when needed, but most users can ignore them.
•	Bayes Heavy: Toggle on for more rigorous, probability-driven inference. Here you'll assign explicit baseline and conditional probabilities for each edge. Structure edits are disabled in this mode; switch back to Lite to revise.
•	Assumptions: Heavy mode assumes independent inputs unless you use logic nodes.

MULTI-SELECT FEATURES:
•	Ctrl+Click (Cmd+Click on Mac): Add/remove individual nodes from selection
•	Drag Box: Click and drag on empty space to select multiple nodes at once
•	Ctrl+A: Select all nodes
•	Delete Key: Delete all selected nodes (with confirmation)
•	Escape: Clear current selection
•	Visual Signals: Apply colors and sizing to all selected nodes simultaneously
•	Selection Panel: Appears on right side when nodes are selected
